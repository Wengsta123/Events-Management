Reports are live!
	... just not on the server right this minute...

	The reports create CSVs

	The password can be reset/changed if needed
		The database does not keep the password in text

	The exported CSV is editable


User Manual
	This week is the technical thesis
	After the thesis, there are two weeks to work on the manual

Installing the app on the server
	Followup email was sent today
		No response

People should not be able to register multiple times for a single event
	Including when an event has multiple event entries

	There is a restriction now that coaches cannot add athletes closer than 2 weeks prior to the event
		It would be nice if the admins could disable sub-admin access
		It would disable a specific competition

		We will talk to Jake to work with it (and see if it's still possible)

Paul's feedback
	Paul tried adding himself as a coach, and he got an error
		Paul is using the (broken) superuser account

	Schedule page needs to have a weekly view
	
	Setting current competition sets the competition to all of the admins

On creation, coaches have automatically assigned some competition
	We need to check with Jake how players get updated between competitions

Scheduler
	It doesn't care how many times you hit it
	But it also doesn't care about previous schedules
		Including manual changes
	
Editing the relay
	There will be a comment in the form that says PRESS CTRL WHEN SELECTING MULTIPLE PLAYERS
