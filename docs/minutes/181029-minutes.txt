Dashboard layouts were shown to Paul and an explanation was provided

   Paul asks that we list junior or senior instead of date of birth

   Date of birth should still be captured for reporting purposes, but should not be displayed in the dashboard

we discussed the details of the scheduling of the four different types of archery events
  
  the details of who can register for each of the types of archery events has been provided in the artifacts
  
  this should be reflected and enforced in the events selection pop up from the add player forms

include the ability to sort by columns for awards purposes (this does not to be available in the dashboard)
  
  the reports must be in such a format that they make this possible
  
  for example, we might enable a csv report as well as a pdf report
	
  the fields that we mostly would focus on are event, name, junior vs senior
  
  this "sortable report" will be useful for scoring purposes which will happen outside the system
  
  more details on what information the scoring system will need will follow

the add player form is no longer two parts, just one (no need for this distinction, it would just complicate things)

	continue functionality is no longer necessary

We ask Paul the questions: how long should players remain in the system? How do we deal with legacy data?

	all players stay there from year to year. coaches or admins can delete the ones they don't want before submission the following year
