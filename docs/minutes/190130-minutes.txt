Server details?
	Need to know what needs in order to setup the server
	We'll send an email describing the server requirements

When coaches login, they can't see old competitions
	Results are always somewhere else
	They just need to be able to input data on their athletes

	Largest county is aroud 25
	
Coach accounts
	Paul doesn't think they'll do anything malicious
	Paul could, on another year, just change what information he needs
	Typically, there's only one person registering the club

	Paul still makes the initial account

	We don't need to worry about them changing their own password
