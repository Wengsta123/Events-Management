2019 January 21

Testing notes from Paul have been made and are here
	Paul will type them up and send them
	Reports didn't work
	Everything else worked

Names needed to be changed:
	Heats -> Relays
	Players -> Athletes or Shooters or Competitors
	Counties -> County/Club or Club
	Gender -> Ongoing debate
		VT -> Uses Gender and Male/Female
		Should be a drop-down
		Not a fill-in-the-blank
		Used for housing
		
Coaches are associated with the athletes
	Athletes are not associated with the county currently

	Athletes should just be associated with the County
	And Coaches should associated with the County
		No direct association with the Coach and Athlete

	Single-session -- typo?

Coach passwords
	Multiple coaches from a single County should be able to login
	(Likely not more than 3)
	Coach should be able to change to their own password
	Admin should be able to change/create the password theirself
		And then the Coach can change the password, too

Formatting
	Phone number? Need a particular format?
		Currently only numbers
	Date
		Month, day, year
		But it gets converted to Year, month, day on output

There are going to be 5 events each year
	And there are sub categories of each event

Shooting events
	Must consider events shot at the same location
	And time
	And players can only shoot at one of either of the heats
	People are only competing with people of the same age group

There will be a hosting provider when it's ready to go

Competitions
	Checking previous years -> Leaving all the previous competitors is necessary
		If someone is too old, they should still be left in the database
	Competitions do not overlap in date/time
	Same competitors go to each

Keep players between competitions?
	Two categories of players
		Active or inactive

	A nice thing to add would be
		If you click on a player, you should be able to see all the events they've competed in over the years

	Events will need to be associated with the Competition

	Delete player would have to remove them from the Competition

	Coaches must be refreshed each competition?
		Paul doesn't think the extra access may be unnecessary

		Coaches will need to be inactivated by the admin as each competition changes

The Coaches tab should be able to change the password
	Don't show the password out right on the page

Spectators
	Needed to be kept track of for housing/meals

	Reports need to be able to do more than a PDF
		CSVs are necessary

	The main point of the application is for sheduling and record keeping
		Everything else, housing, meals, payments, will be done as usual
Reports form
	All Players and All Clubs reports return the same report
	Intentional -- looks the same given a small sample competition

	Can be solved by a CSV report

Creating a player
	Linked via coach id, not name or anything useful
	Should be Club (and not club id)

Admin will create a shell Club for the coach to fill out
