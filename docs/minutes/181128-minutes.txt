Paul wants a Player report?
County/Club report to be printed
	Each player on a single report has a time slot and event
	The report should be succinct and on as few pages as possible

Last meeting before break
	End of semester -> Paul will get instructions via email to work with a demo online
		Should have login credentials
	Off of the Paris server
	There will be testing data online
	
The scheduler will be worked on to some degree ths sprint
	Next semester is for most of the work

Paul gets to see the reports at the moment
	Paul may want to see some kind of feedback that the machine is working?
	The report shows whatever data you program it to
	Paul wants alphabetical order
	Paul likes that you can select a county
	Paul: DoB is only for Junior/Senior
		Doesn't need to be visible on the report
		Should be accessible but not something you need to print

Paul mentioned the student evaluations

A head-coach in a club
	There can be other coaches in a club
	A county is a team
	Team scores are independent of the county

	County should be called a club

	A club should initially have a coach

There may be un-affiliated adults who are not in clubs, but must be handled in the database for support, housing, meals
	We are not scheduling meals

	Adults (volunteers) need to be in the system
		For housing, meals

		Though Paul could have a bodge to add volunteers to the system
		We will add a table to the database to keep track of volunteers

		Everyone who needs to get food or housing must be entered into the database

	Information to collect:
		Separation between Parents or Volunteers
			People who volunteer get free stuff
			Parents don't
		Another category:
			Match Director
		Non-participating children can come
		Other adults can come

		Don't care about who their player is
		Need Name, email, phone, county/club (optional)

	There are walk-in registrations at the event
		Or absences
		This part is by hand
