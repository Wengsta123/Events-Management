Desired: Entry form -> Transfers automatically to squadding
	
Players don't interact with the system
	Sometimes you have a county with a single participant
	So the kid would be the coach

Some events are limited - as in they can sign up for 4 sqaudded events on Sat and 4 on Sun
	There are other mechanics

Admin creates coach accounts
	Coaches get information via email

There should be a security mechanism

Round-robin event scheduling?
	Leave a break if you can
	Schedule should be able to be modified after the fact


Admin needs complete access to everything

Desired: Individual player printing
	
We should be able to change the event details
