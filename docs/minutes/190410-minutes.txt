Last meeting!!!
	Jake is absent

We will not be changing the database any
	Previously, Paul wanted to change the application to lock out coaches after a certain time
	Paul would rather just go in and change their passwords after a certain time

We are testing things for now

	The application uses a framework called Django
		In a language in Python
	The scheduler is in C
