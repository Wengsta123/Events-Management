Wireframes displayed to Paul
	Explanation

	Paul should get a copy to give us more feedback

	Last name and first name need to be split


Some categories need to split into sub categories

Coach adding to system would be restricted to some level
	To be determined
	Can't add people to specific heats

	There can be more than one coach per county

Gender is asked for housing reasons

Adding/Removing events
	Events have locations
	Multiple events could have the same location

Scheduling
	If something changes, (a lack and/or surplus of entries) then
		Heat schedules need to change
	Scheduling should optimize for the number of people in the heat
		and minimize the heat totals
		Gives more flexibility
		Even out the number of people in a heat

	The scheduler should do the initial work, and
		the admin needs to be able to change anything

	Admins should be able to swap players

Paul will assume that we are meeting if there is no message

It is fine if the scheduler creates a heat of all one county's members
	Try to round-robin the scheuduler

Coaches
	They can either have their accounts created for them with a generated password <- yes
	Or they could get a protected link to create an account <- no

	Paul wants to be able to set coach access to counties
	And the ability to add more admins
