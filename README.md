The Shooting Education program uses shooting as a vehicle to teach youth ages 9 to 19 life skills such as responsibility, self discipline, and teamwork. The following disciplines are used to teach these life skills â€“ archery, muzzleloading, pistol, rifle, and shotgun. Through these disciplines, youth also learn firearm safety and marksmanship. The system is for managing event for the Virginia 4-H Shooting Education Program. The system should allow admins to create accounts for coaches. The coaches should be able to create profiles for their players. And, submit applications to register their players for events. The administrator should be able to edit player profiles and create coach profiles with necessary information. The administrator should be able to create and event that has multiple days with multiple activities running throughout the day. The admin should be able to check players applications and assign players to a certain time slot per activity per event. The admin should be able to create any number of activities for a given day in an event. The admin should be able to print out reports for a player or a coach. The coach should be able to see when his or her players are playing. The system should generate a report for each activity and for time slot in an activity.
